## SUMMARY:
Please make sure you have completed the soot survey at:
    [soot.binghamton.edu](https://soot.binghamton.edu)

Please list the urls for the APIs you used:

* Dad Joke API: https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api
* Zoo Animal API: https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com/
* Fruit API:
* https://www.fruityvice.com/

Summary of Program:

Allows you to make random animals do various things. Currently, this list includes:
* Telling dad jokes
* Simulating fights
* Choosing favorite fruits

Most Challenging topic in the course:

* In terms of knowlegde needed to complete the course, pygame (and by extension, Chapter 9: Graphic User Interfaces). This is because we had to get very familiar with how to use pygame in order to complete our final project.
* In terms of course chapters, Chapter 10: Files (because it required us to work with json, and interact with non-Python files), or Chapter 11: Requests (because we spent the least time on it, and because it's daunting to write code designed to interact over a network.)
